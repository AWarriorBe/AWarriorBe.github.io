Too much of it certainly is, but stress is not always a bad thing. In order to improve and grow stronger, you must push to the point of failure ... of course, it should not be the point of fatal failure. Ideally, it should not be to the point of serious injury although things like weightlifting necessarily involve minor *microinjuries* of muscle tissue ... it's necessary to understand where the [hormetic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis) is in the [dose response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose%E2%80%93response_relationship) curve.  Within the hormetic zone there is generally a favorable biological responses to low exposures to stressors.
