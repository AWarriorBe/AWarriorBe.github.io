This posting is intended to *eventually* become a chapter or part of *The Essence of Being A Warrior*

## Discipline

Warriors must train to develop the DISCIPLINE necessary for NEVER quitting. DISCIPLINE will carry the warrior when it is not possible to think and serious battles and war is ultimately about being in a position where it is simply impossible to THINK. This is why DISCIPLINE EQUALS FREEDOM ... it is impossible to think your way or reason your way to freedom, freedom only happens through DISCIPLINE, ie "freedom isn't free."  But discipline also does not develop simply out of pure will ... building discipline is like building muscle, mostly, it requires EFFORT and repetition ... it requires doing stuff that you know that you need to do ... it can even require extreme stuff that most people will not understand, such as getting up at 4:30 in the morning to do burpees until you puke in the trash can.

### Intention

One needs to have a WHY ... you can do something simple like establish the intention to get up and walk through the doorway to go into the other room, but you sort of need a WHY ... you don't just get up, put what you are doing aside and walk through the door unless there's some sort of reason ... maybe this is not a good example, because the cost of walking through the doorway into another room is so trivial it's not worth talking about, BUT you still need a REASON ... the reason might be just to prove to someone else that you will walk through the doorway into the other room just because someone else says you won't or can't do it ... but THAT, the exercise of one's pride or vanity, can often be enough of a reason [in small things].  This changes if the other room is on fire and it's likely that you will not survive walking through that doorway ... of course, you will also do this WITH INTENTION if you have a sufficiently strong WHY, eg your baby daughter is in the room that is on fire.

Intention is kind of a big thing ... so big, that we often WANT to just take it for granted. We shouldn't.  We should understand SOMETHING about how our INTENTION is shaped and formed ... even though we should also understand that we can never be self-aware enough to really understand fully how it happens ... a cartoon figure cannot draw itself and its future self in future scenes and WE are the cartoon figures in this case ... we might be the cartoon figure who is a cartoonist in the cartoon's stories, but we are not the main Cartoonist.

### Neurobiology

Neuroanatomy precedes neurochemistry.

### Morality and choice

Free will drives where we, or our species, will be in the next year, next decade, next century.

Our existence is not random, but it is also not predictable or something that is purely bound to happen.
