Weapons of mass destruction have value ONLY as a deterrent. If they are ever used, they unleash far too much mayhem, chaos, suffering and death. Paradoxically however, they have no value as a deterrent unless an enemy really and truly believes that they will be used if an opponent is pushed to the point of where the opponent's survival is unlikely and the opponent feels that they have no other choice but to use them.

The important thing for anyone thinking about the strategic implications of weapons of mass destruction is understand that there's a high likelihood that your thinking is either just flat out wrong OR that your opponent will not think the way that you do or will see how you think and devise a way to outflank your stategy. In other words, it is a very serious matter and in serious matters, humility and the recognition that you might be wrong is ESSENTIAL. The is the ESSENCE of being a warrior who actually has a chance of survival.

I am not much interested in being a warrior who is angling to be a martyr and I don't think that most human beings are delusional enough to imagine that we want to be martyrs, but we would be beyond foolish if we imagined that our opponents might not be exactly that delusional. This does NOT mean that we ever give in to crazy people or despots behaving in an irrational fashion -- it means that we must be humble, cautious and LISTEN very closely to exactly what delusional people say and pay attention to how they act. The only way to defeat a delusional opponent is to do something that is radically unexpected ... there is no formula for what the radically unexpected strategy is -- the ONLY way to get there is to LISTEN and understand what the delusional opponent expects or wants ... when the delusional opponent wants the benefit of martyrdom, which means that the opponent believes that people will somehow hold the martyr in reverence or high esteem, it is necessary to take the benefit of martyrdom away ... doing that is impossible without very careful LISTENING.
