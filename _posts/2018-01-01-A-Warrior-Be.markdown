If it wasn't already obvious, I am still working at setting up the structure and workflow for this little side project ... so there's a lot TBD ... actually, it's more accurate to say that a LOT MORE stuff has already been done but there's still a lot to re-org, bring together in some sort of cohesive fashion and customize for a specific objective.  

The objective of the whole thing is a set of repos [most adapted and cloned from other interesting work] that people will be able to use to set-up and configure an lite, efficient dashboard/editor app [or possibly set of packages for something like Atom] that helps people to train, organize, synchronize,5S and generally stay focused on the road ahead to build discipline ... other than that, maybe the rest of this is all TL;DR ... continue reading if you want, otherwise just *chill, relax, be happy and carry on*

# Learning how to Learn

Education should be about training us to be able to train for the next step in training for a tough mission. We should train ourselves to do the impossible, by training successively to accomplish more and more difficult objectives.

Learning how to learn is really about breaking down a long training project into tasks that build upon competencies developed from other tasks ... that might sound simple enough in theory, but it's damned hard to do in practice ... you may have heard it said that *"no plan ever survives contact with the enemy"* and that is very true ... and it can be extremely frustrating, confusing and even demoralizing ... a serious enough injury sustained during training, for example, basically ends that particular training session -- it doesn't necessarily always need that we have to abandon the program of training but we might have to attack the problem from a different angle or even embark on a totally different program of trainiing ... but **the essence of being a warrior is to never quit on yourself or your larger mission.**

THAT essence is really what this project is all about ... it's really a matter of learning how to learn, especially when you are going to train with sufficient intensity and with sufficiently aggressive goals that you are likely to experience failures that you don't just shake off and go back to the same old plan.
