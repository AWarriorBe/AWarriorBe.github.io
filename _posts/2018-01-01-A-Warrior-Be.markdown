I accept that people are different, hold very different views, but my views with respect to the importance of fighting for greater freedom, greater independence are pretty much the way that they are going to be. I will not stop fighting. Ever. I work at being more disciplined; I try to live according to something resembling a warrior ethic; I fail but I don't quit and I will keep trying to strengthen my discipline in order to be more ready and able to fight for greater freedom and independence.

I took an Oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That Constitution is a beautiful document with long history of development spanning thousands of years. The Constitution still captures the essential push for greater independence and freedom of the individual and equal protection under the law for the Life, Liberty and Property of all persons. That is what I fight for. An Oath is something of solemn seriousness -- I have never been relieved of the obligations of that Oath. So people [especially those who have never taken the Oath, never served or knowingly risked making an ultimate sacrifice] will disagree on the priority that I place on discipline and distributed security and defense ... that's ok. Their priorities are not mine.

The objective of the whole AWarriorBe thing is infrastructure ... that means personal infrastrucure-as-code, a set of repos [most adapted and cloned from other appropriate tools] that people will be able to use to set-up and configure a lite personal operating system for efficient messaging and a blockchain-based network of smart accounts, an efficient, simple dashboard/editor app [with packages to add features] that takes care of the task of managing trivial chores and daily workflow ... personal infrastructure-as code is about an individual being in control of configuration management [rather than a centralized social network or device provider] that helps individuals to train, organize, synchronize,5S and generally stay focused on the road ahead to build discipline ... beyond that, maybe the rest of this is all too speculative and TL;DR ... continue reading if you want, otherwise just *chill, relax, be happy and carry on*

# War is HELL

Ok, I know some Biblical scholar will tell why Hell is worse than any war ... people with cancer ward experience might want to suggest that radiation poisoning or parents watching their children die a slow death is just as bad ... and I won't debate the point -- war is bad enough and I'm no fan of cancer; it's pointless to discuss what *pegs the meter* ... but I do not believe that genuine warriors want a hot war for others ... maybe some do or think that they do, for themselves ... most warriors prepare for war in order to make war much less likely and to end it quickly if it ever breaks out. Some warriors may be conditioned by their experience [and the various neurochemicals released] to find being in a state of war more tolerable or may even feel comfortable or most at ease in war and war fighting ... but warriors understand how dreadful the mayhem, chaos and inescapable terror is to others humans in the vicinity -- warriors understand why their enemies to be uncomfortable enough to stop, but that kind of suffering is not the wish of thinking warriors for OTHER bystanders caught in the crossfire.

This book is not about play. Of course, I grew up acting out my own commando fantasies, but I have always been ambivalent about GI Joe dolls and playing at war ... I get why it is natural for most [maybe not all] boys and maybe some girls AND why playing at being a warrior has been part of childhood development and human nature for tens of thousands of years -- I do not believe it should be encouraged or discouraged -- it's natural, but parents should make sure that play is safe, ie not ever allow PLAYING with real weapons ... weapons and care of weapons is SERIOUS adult stuff; kids should recognize that weapons are not for PLAY.  So I am nervous about "making a buck off of it" or promoting it for economic gain ... but then again kids want toys and some toymaker will provide the toys, so kids might as well have the BEST toys. My uncle (ie a Chief Pharmacists Mate with the 1st Marines Division in WWII), either the toughest man or *maybe* the second toughest man I've ever known was definitely not a fan of GI Joe stuff ... I remember well having to make sure that some of my toys were out of sight when Uncle Ben and Aunt Jane visited ... years of day-after-day triaging Marines and parts of Marines [along with Japanese], on the front of the front lines and watching way too boys many die in complete agony takes the shine off of enthusiasm for war ... I don't want war ... but whether we like it or not, war comes about because of a lack of discipline, a lack of READINESS to end war quickly when war breaks out ... so this book is about DISCIPLINE ... and thinking about discipline, instilling discipline, developing a climate that generally tends to instill discipline.

It's NOT a cookbook with *do this every day and you'll develop discipline* discipline recipes ... simple recipe texts for that purpose already exist and should be followed; simple does NOT mean easy. This book is NOT really a field manual; it's not even a policy manual ... it's more about the philosophy for trying to think about facing and reducing the likelihood of war -- without slipping into the old trap of believing that we have ALL of the answers for ALL situations ... it's for thinking about how we should think about generally doing the most we can do to encourage discipline while wanting for others as we would want things for ourselves ... it is, therefore, about highly distributed security and defense.

# Learning how to Learn

EVERYTHING important in life is about some aspect of learning how to deal with the things that are coming up ... in anything, even relationships, parenting, leading others -- the task at hand now is about learning something important for something more important that is coming up ... so PAY ATTENTION! If you imagine that you are paying attention, try to remove what is distracting you to pay even more attention. Do not fall into the trap of DOING too much, pay attention so that you are only doing WHAT MATTERS.

Many educational systems are not really all that educational. Education should be about training us to be able to train for the next step in training for a tough mission. We should train ourselves to do the impossible, by training successively to accomplish more and more difficult objectives ... in other words, we should train to make ourselves uncomfortable, to the point of a failure ... recovering from failure is the essence of learning how to learn.

Learning how to learn is really about breaking down a long training project into tasks that build upon competencies developed from other tasks ... that might sound simple enough in theory, but it's damned hard to do in practice ... you may have heard it said that *"no plan ever survives contact with the enemy"* and that is very true ... and it can be extremely frustrating, confusing and even demoralizing ... a serious enough injury sustained during training, for example, basically ends that particular training session -- it doesn't necessarily always need that we have to abandon the program of training but we might have to attack the problem from a different angle or even embark on a totally different program of training ... but **the essence of being a warrior is to never quit on yourself or your larger mission.**

THAT essence ... surmounting the seemingly insurmountable difficulties of learning how to learn ... is really what this project is all about ... it's really a matter of learning how to learn, especially when you are going to train with sufficient intensity and with sufficiently aggressive goals that you are likely to experience failures that you don't just shake off the setback and immediately go back to where you left off in the same old plan. Learning how to learn is largely a matter of learning how to deal with setbacks ... to some degree, this is often like teaching what you have learned to others in that in order to really teach them, you can't *just* teach them the way that you have learned something, you need to understand how they think to understand where the impediment in their thinking is ... you cannot get over that impediment for them, but you must understand the difficulty they face so that your approach offers the correct form of encouragement ... often, it can be a matter of just trying harder -- but that's not ALWAYS true. Sometimes, it's necessary to re-group, re-think and work your way through a new [Observe-Orient-Decide-Act or OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) with them ... and just as with other aspects of training someone else, you cannot really teach the OODA loop to someone, they must implement themselves ... and, as with any other skill that we attempt to make reflexive or even involuntary, they must master the discipline of navigating the OODA repeatedly OR else they will freeze [and perhaps die] when they actually need the lesson they've once learned. *It's kinda serious business ...*

# Not being impotent  

Whenever you brag about how tough you are or whatever impossible fights you've been through ... or engage in any kind of dick-measuring contest to stupidly assert your own bona fides ... you basically render yourself impotent. Whenever you brag of how tough you are, people know EXACTLY how tough you are ... and that means they have an idea of what you consider to be your limits; in other words, they know how tough you ARE NOT.  It's not usually that someone will defeat you by escalating past your limits ... even idiots are smart enough not enough to use brute force, ramming their head into a brick wall ... when you brag, you indicate where your focus is and, it doesn't take that much to figure out how to outflank someone whose focus is all upon their majestic, impenetrable, ultra-solid front ... there's nothing easier to load on the trailer heading for the slaughter plant than a horny bull with the hard prick who imagines that he can *screw any heifer he wants* ... it's pretty easy to manipulate any bully or anyone too stuck on themselves. But most bullies seem to operate from a base of fear or insecurity ... maybe they have just never really understood that **the first rule that any dog who wants to be a BIG dog should remember is that "BIG dogs don't bark!"**

# The Golden Rule and Respect

The Golden Rule is something like "Respect others as you would want to be respected." This has many different manifestations; there are different ways of phrasing it ... . Most people just want to be left alone ... so the practical interpretation of the Golden Rule is something like, "Don't hurt people and don't take their stuff ... because you would not want to be hurt for no good reason and you don't want your stuff to be messed with."  

I am interested learning more, that means making new friends and finding people who get me, who I can trust to train with.  If there's one thing that I am absolutely certain of, it is that every human ever born could teach me something about being a better warrior ... every human should be accorded respect ... obviously, there would be those who would be more suitable friends or those who can teach me faster, quicker, more directly ... but mostly, EVERY HUMAN PERSON SHOULD BE ACCORDED A FUNDAMENTAL BASELINE OF RESPECT. This is the fundamental principle driving the Golden Rule.

RESPECT ... and different, appropriately earned levels of levels of respect, eg being a good taxpaying, voting citizen vs taking the Oath to support and defend vs being a decorated combat Veteran ... and doing my part to advance and reinforce the very basic, very simple lessons of respect matters a lot to me ... respect is the foundation of what is necessary for sustaining a better, more decent, more civil and humane world. We don't have to all hug and kiss each other and sing kumbayah around the drum circle with the tribe; we do not need to agree on very much -- we just need to agree on the fundamental notion that EVERY HUMAN SHOULD BE ACCORDED RESPECT and that different levels of respect can be earned.  

Without RESPECT for other humans ... without respect for Life, Liberty and Property of all persons ... and, at minimum, agreement on the rule that every human person should be accorded respect ... and respect for life, liberty and property matters in that order ... we do not have law, order, civility and the ability to make it through the day in some semblence of a coherent fashion goes downhill fast ... the world is not fair, but you could say that respect is *kinda serious business ...*
