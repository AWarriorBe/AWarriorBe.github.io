If it wasn't already obvious, I am still working at setting up the structure and workflow for this little side project ... so there's a lot TBD ... actually, it's more accurate to say that a LOT MORE stuff has already been done but there's still a lot to re-org, bring together in some sort of cohesive fashion and customize for a specific objective.  

The objective of the whole thing is a set of repos [most adapted and cloned from other interesting work] that people will be able to use to set-up and configure an lite, efficient dashboard/editor app [or possibly set of packages for something like Atom] that helps people to train, organize, synchronize,5S and generally stay focused on the road ahead to build discipline ... other than that, maybe the rest of this is all TL;DR ... continue reading if you want, otherwise just *chill, relax, be happy and carry on*

# Learning how to Learn

Education should be about training us to be able to train for the next step in training for a tough mission. We should train ourselves to do the impossible, by training successively to accomplish more and more difficult objectives.

Learning how to learn is really about breaking down a long training project into tasks that build upon competencies developed from other tasks ... that might sound simple enough in theory, but it's damned hard to do in practice ... you may have heard it said that *"no plan ever survives contact with the enemy"* and that is very true ... and it can be extremely frustrating, confusing and even demoralizing ... a serious enough injury sustained during training, for example, basically ends that particular training session -- it doesn't necessarily always need that we have to abandon the program of training but we might have to attack the problem from a different angle or even embark on a totally different program of trainiing ... but **the essence of being a warrior is to never quit on yourself or your larger mission.**

THAT essence ... surmounting the seemingly insurmountable difficulties of learning how to learn ... is really what this project is all about ... it's really a matter of learning how to learn, especially when you are going to train with sufficient intensity and with sufficiently aggressive goals that you are likely to experience failures that you don't just shake off the setback and immediately go back to where you left off in the same old plan. Learning how to learn is largely a matter of learning how to deal with setbacks ... to some degree, this is often like teaching what you have learned to others in that in order to really teach them, you can't *just* teach them the way that you have learned something, you need to understand how they think to understand where the impediment in their thinking is ... you cannot get over that impediment for them, but you must understand the difficulty they face so that your approach offers the correct form of encouragement ... often, it can be a matter of just trying harder -- but that's not ALWAYS true. Sometimes, it's necessary to re-group, re-think and work your way through a new [Observe-Orient-Decide-Act or OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) with them ... and just as with other aspects of training someone else, you cannot really teach the OODA loop to someone, they must implement themselves ... and, as with any other skill that we attempt to make reflexive or even involuntary, they must master the discipline of navigating the OODA repeatedly OR else they will freeze [and perhaps die] when they actually need the lesson they've once learned. *It's kinda serious business ...*

# Not being impotent  

Whenever you brag about how tough you are or whatever impossible fights you've been through ... or engage in any kind of dick-measuring contest to stupidly assert your own bona fides ... you basically render yourself impotent. Whenever you brag of how tough you are, people know EXACTLY how tough you are ... and that means they have an idea of what you consider to be your limits; in other words, they know how tough you ARE NOT.
