## Programming

What you buy, what you accumulate, what you put into your body and your brain will define you.

Most of us could afford to lose a couple pounds; most of us have too much stuff ... most of us would benefit from fasting and something of a detox ... this does NOT mean buying or accumulating or do something to induce a detoxification ... this means just NOT SWALLOWING anything for awhile ... and then being very, very, very careful about how you program your future with what you consume after fasting.  

Yes, you have it right ... fasting is not just about food ... it applies to social media, what you think you need to watch on your screen, where you imagine that you need to drive, what you imagine that you really need to buy ... fasting is NOT about starving ... fasting programs involves breaking the fast with periods of extremely mindful, deliberate, careful consumption and ENJOYMENT of consumption ... thus, fasting is primarily about learning to control your appetite in order to appreciate what you consume more AND to consume only the right things.

If you are serious about programming yourself to be MORE successful, you probably need to fast ... unless you are one of the very small minority of people who already have extremely ascetic tendencies.

## Advertising

We are continually being advertised ... advertising works because it is repetitious and never stops working on your subconscious ... advertising is MOST effective in the minds of people who arrogantly imagine "Bullshit! Advertising doesn't work on me -- I'm not that easily controlled." ... intellectuals and people who imagine that they are smarter than others are most easily hypnotized and controlled by advertising -- because advertising is always crafted to match their particular stylistic choices or values and it is particularly effective when it points a finger at some other group, ie "those stupid, deplorable Trump supporters" and appeals to the sanctimonious pride and jealousy that is endemic in humans.   

## Tracking

Advertising and similar forms of programming and hypnosis are more effective than ever because of how advertising is tracked, analyzed, measured and then continually tweaked to be more and more and more effective.  Advertising is MOST effective on people who imagine that they have opted out of advertising ... because, in those people, it is much more easy to track things like product placement or political advertisements masquerading as journalism or serious news reportage.
