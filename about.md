A Warrior Be is an organizational grouping which includes the Essence of Being A Warrior blog which is the basis of book project, something akin to MIL-HDBK sort of field manual. The ultimate objective of A Warrior Be goes beyond writing ... ultimately, it's about set of repositories for producing an executable configurable dashboard app for content management, tracking goals and most importantly for clarifying values and personal philosophy with important questions to ask oneself, to ponder, act upon, write about ... unless one develops one's personal philosophy, one is effectively serving another's philosophy and that means that all of the work of goals that are set, action plans that developed and implemented, agendas that are served are someone else's agenda.

## Containers

Develop a workflow that works for you.

I will describe how I containerize my week into time blocks to work 6 days a week, 15 hrs/day doing things that I love. I don't think you should do things that you don't love for very long, but sometimes you have to pay the bills ... the most important aspect of paying the bills is lowering the cost of your existence ... a sign of a truly pathetic existence is one that costs too much to maintain. An ideal existence pays its own way ... but you can never attain that ideal if your lifestyle is too costly and accordingly you must work to maintain it.
