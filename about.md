A Warrior Be is the organizational group around the Essence of Being A Warrior blog that will become a book project for producing a MIL-HDBK sort of field manual with an aim toward ultimately producing repositories for a personal configurable dashboard app of important questions to ask oneself, to ponder, act upon, write about, set goals, develop coherent action plans and to do more complicated things, projects and ventures that matter.

## Containers

Develop a workflow that works for you.

I will describe how I containerize my week into time blocks to work 6 days a week, 15 hrs/day doing things that I love. I don't think you should do things that you don't love for very long, but sometimes you have to pay the bills ... the most important aspect of paying the bills is lowering the cost of your existence ... a sign of a truly pathetic existence is one that costs too much to maintain. An ideal existence pays its own way ... but you can never attain that ideal if your lifestyle is too costly and accordingly you must work to maintain it.
